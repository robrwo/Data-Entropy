version 0.007; 2011-04-27

  * update D::E::RS::RandomOrg to cope with fractional fill percentage
    currently being returned by the website

  * in D::E::RS::RandomOrg and D::E::RS::RandomnumbersInfo, use HTTP::Lite
    instead of heavyweight LWP

  * use full stricture in test suite

  * in Build.PL, complete declaration of configure-time requirements

  * explicitly state version required of Params::Classify

  * include META.json in distribution

  * add MYMETA.json and MYMETA.yml to .cvsignore

version 0.006; 2009-11-21

  * be more stringent in parsing responses from networked entropy sources

  * in documentation, point more prominently to Data::Entropy::Algorithms

  * in documentation of Data::Entropy::Algorithms, more discussion of
    overriding CORE::rand, including how to override it globally

  * abandon use of the "fields" module

  * use simpler "parent" pragma in place of "base"

  * check for required Perl version at runtime

  * in test suite, properly quote first argument to use_ok (lack of
    quoting caused false test failures on Perl 5.11.2)

  * in Build.PL, explicitly declare configure-time requirements

  * remove bogus "exit 0" from Build.PL

version 0.005; 2009-03-03

  * bugfix: require bugfixed version of Data::Float (for $SIG{__DIE__}
    handling)

  * in D::E::RS::RandomOrg and D::E::RS::RandomnumbersInfo, be more
    stringent in parsing the returned data, to avoid potentially
    generating non-byte bytes

  * test POD syntax and coverage, and rename some internal functions
    and make a small style change in documentation to satisfy the
    coverage test

  * drop prototypes from method subs (where the prototypes have no effect)

  * in tests, avoid unreliable "\d" and "\w" regexp elements

  * remove a stray "use Crypt::Rijndael" from one of the test scripts

  * build with Module::Build instead of ExtUtils::MakeMaker

  * complete dependency list

  * express relationship with versions of Math::BigInt and Math::BigRat
    as conflicts rather than dependencies

  * include signature in distribution

  * in documentation, separate "license" section from "copyright" section

version 0.004; 2007-09-03

  * in D::E::RS::CryptCounter, construct the SEEK_* constants explicitly
    instead of importing from Fcntl, to avoid requiring a version of
    Fcntl that is only supplied with perl v5.8

  * test explicitly for correct class of results

version 0.003; 2007-01-21

  * avoid "my __PACKAGE__", for compatibility with perl v5.6

  * markup fix in documentation for rand_flt()

version 0.002; 2006-08-05

  * bugfix: rand_flt() with subnormal limits was horribly inefficient

  * in rand(), don't attempt to generate a 48-bit fraction on systems
    where it can't be represented, fall back to the longest possible
    fraction

  * in rand_fix(), use low-level floating point code from Data::Float
    instead of doing it here

  * expand documentation of rand()

version 0.001; 2006-08-03

  * new function rand_flt() to generate a random floating point value
    in a floating point way

  * bugfix: in BigRat handling, use ->as_number instead of ->as_int
    for BigRat->BigInt conversion, because ->as_int is faulty before
    Math::BigRat version 0.14 but ->as_number is available in much earlier
    versions (the version specified in Makefile.PL was one where ->as_int
    was faulty)

  * use standard interval notation in the Data::Entropy::Algorithms
    documentation

  * use "=> 0" instead of "=> undef" in unversioned dependencies in
    Makefile.PL

  * don't include underscore in string version of module version numbers
    in Makefile.PL

  * remove a redundant BigRat->BigInt conversion

version 0.000; 2006-07-19

  * initial released version
